I use a simple template match to find the secret spots in the video. So this is
nothing for a dynamical video. It should be used to clean up for screen records.

Why
---
Blurring is designed to expand `Watch me Coding <https://github.com/axju/wmc>`_.
I take my screen in time lapse. One second, one frame. That's 3600 frames for
an hour. An 8-hour coding day would be 28800 frames. I do not want to search
for secret information in every single frame. I know my secret passwords so I
can scan the video and blur them.

Install
-------
Simple as always. Do not forget to use a virtual environment::

  >>> pip install blurring

How to uses
-----------
Create a template. You can use any image. Maybe something created with gimp. Or
us supplied tool "blurring-t" (I know that is a ugly name, sorry)::

  >>> blurring-t template
  text [PASSWORD]: PASSWORD
  height [18]: 18
  ...

Before you blur the video, checkout the original.

Now blur it::

  blurring video.mp4 blurred.mp4 template.png

This is the result.

There is still something to improve, but for now I am happy.


Watch me coding integration
---------------------------
This is also a plugin for watch me encoding. After you have installed Blurring,
there is an additional command::

  >>> wmc -H
          info v0.3.3 - Print some infos
          link v0.3.3 - Concat all videos to one
        record v0.3.3 - Start the record
         setup v0.3.3 - Setup the project
      blurring v0.1.0 - Blur the final video

First create the final video::

  >>> wmc link

Now create the template(s)::

  >>> mkdir templates
  >>> blurring-t templates/dummy
  text [PASSWORD]: PASSWORD
  height [18]: 18
  width [70]: 70
  scale [0.4]: 0.4
  font [0]: 0
  pos_x [0]: 0
  pos_y [12]: 12

It is time to blurring out the "PASSWORD"::

  >>> wmc blurring

Now you have the video "full_blur.mp4". Enjoy it.
